Hello, my name is **Mikhail Kozlov**.
I'm a 19 years old backend [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) software developer with 5+ years of experience. 
I love writing software solutions with using my favourite development techniques and patterns and very proud of my open-source projects (**which will be placed here soon, so you'll be able to observe what projects I did and doing now**). I'm learning new programming skills and now actually trying self as front-end developer with using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) web frameworks, and sure, with using modern UI libraries such as [MaterialUI](https://mui.com).
